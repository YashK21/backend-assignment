# Stock Trading Bot Backend

## Overview

This is a simple backend application built using Node.js and Express that simulates a stock trading bot. It allows fetching stock prices, simulating buying and selling stocks, and handling stock data using mock JSON files.

### Features:

- Fetch stock prices for different stocks (Apple, Google, Tesla).
- Simulate buying and selling stocks.
- Uses mock data for stock prices for demonstration purposes.

## Technologies Used:

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **Mock Data** (Stored in JSON files)

## Endpoints:

### 1. Fetch Stock Price:

- **Endpoint**: `/api/stocks/:stockName/price`
- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Fetches a random price for the specified stock (`apple`, `google`, `tesla`).

Example:

````bash
GET /api/stocks/apple/price

```json
{
  "name": "AAPL (Apple)",
  "price": 105
}
Example Response:
json

{
  "name": "AAPL (Apple)",
  "price": 105
}
2. Get Portfolio Status:
Endpoint: /api/stocks/status
Method: GET
Description: Returns the current balance, portfolio, and total profit/loss of the bot.
Example Request:
bash

GET /api/stocks/status
Example Response:
json

{
  "balance": 950,
  "portfolio": {
    "AAPL": {
      "quantity": 2,
      "buyPrice": 100
    },
    "TSLA": {
      "quantity": 1,
      "buyPrice": 95
    }
  },
  "profitLoss": 30
}
3. Simulate Trading:
Endpoint: /api/stocks/trade
Method: POST
Description: Simulates the trading logic, including buying and selling stocks based on predefined rules (2% price drop for buy, 3% price rise for sell). The trading logic runs every 5 seconds and checks the conditions to execute trades automatically.
Example Request:
bash

POST /api/stocks/trade
Response:
json

{
  "message": "Trading simulation running. Check the logs for trade execution."
}
4. Check Trade Logs:
Endpoint: /api/stocks/logs
Method: GET
Description: Returns a log of all executed trades, including buy and sell transactions.
Example Request:
bash

GET /api/stocks/logs
Example Response:
json

[
  {
    "stock": "AAPL",
    "action": "buy",
    "quantity": 1,
    "price": 100,
    "timestamp": "2024-10-04T10:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    "stock": "TSLA",
    "action": "sell",
    "quantity": 1,
    "price": 120,
    "timestamp": "2024-10-04T10:05:00Z"
  }
]
Trading Simulation Logic:
Buy: The bot automatically buys stocks when the stock price drops by more than 2% from the last buy price.
Sell: The bot sells stocks when the stock price rises by more than 3% from the last buy price.
Forced Sell: Stocks are automatically sold after being held for more than 2 minutes.
Trade Failure: Thereâ€™s a 10% chance that a trade (buy/sell) fails to simulate real-world conditions.
The trading bot runs every 5 seconds to check if any stock satisfies the buy/sell conditions.

How to Use
Prerequisites:
Node.js (v14.x or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Getting Started:
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

bash

git clone <repository-url>
cd backend-assignment
Install dependencies:

bash

npm install
Start the application:

bash

npm start
The server will run on http://localhost:3000.

Example Requests:
1. Fetching the current price for Apple stock:
bash

curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/stocks/apple/price
2. Fetching the bot's portfolio and profit/loss status:
bash

curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/stocks/status
3. Starting the trading simulation:
bash

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/stocks/trade
4. Viewing the trade logs:
bash

curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/stocks/logs
JSON File Structure:
Each stock has a corresponding JSON file that contains the stock name and an array of prices. Example for Apple_MOCK_DATA.json:

json
{
  "name": "AAPL (Apple)",
  "prices": [
    { "price": 105 },
    { "price": 107 },
    { "price": 103 },
    { "price": 91 },
    { "price": 110 }
  ]
}
Notes:
Mock Data: The application uses mock data for stock prices stored in the data folder. To simulate real-world data, these mock files are used for demonstration purposes.
Stock Trading Simulation: This is a simplified simulation that does not connect to real stock exchanges. For real-world use, the mock data would be replaced with live data from stock APIs.
Future Improvements:
Add support for real-time stock APIs to fetch live prices.
Implement advanced trading strategies like Moving Average Crossover or Momentum Trading.
Enhance the error-handling mechanism for failed trades.
